[*SparkFun Roshamglo (KIT-14130)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14130)


The SparkFun Roshamglo is a badge that can be worn with a lanyard clip that has been designed to play Rock Paper Scissors. The board uses the ATtiny84, and has an IR LED and receiver to communicate between badges. To play, simply point the USB connector at your opponents controller up to 5 feet away and press the 5-way switch to the left for rock, up for paper, and right for scissors. The red/green LED will display a solid red for lose, green for win, or alternate red and green for a tie. The Roshamglo uses the [Micronucleaus](https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus) bootloader, which allows for USB programming from the Arduino IDE.
